# Inspiration

While writing online, whether drafting an email, texting a colleague, or publishing a blog post, we often wish for a quick second opinion. But usually, that means copying text somewhere else, waiting for results, and then pasting it all back. It is too much effort for a quick check.

Proofectly removes all that friction by letting you improve your writing right where you are, without ever leaving your current tab.

# What it does

Proofectly lives in your browser’s context menu. You can simply select any text, right-click, and choose from Proofread, Rewrite, or Summarize.

In seconds, Proofectly shows you an AI-enhanced version of your text. With one click, you can replace the original text instantly.

No tab switching, no copy-paste chaos. It all happens seamlessly, in place.

What makes Proofectly special is that it uses Chrome’s built-in AI APIs, which run entirely on your device. Your text never leaves your computer, making it private, secure, and ideal for sensitive writing such as business emails, legal drafts, or personal notes. And it also means there are no subscription charges, no usage caps, just pure AI assistance, right at your fingertips.
